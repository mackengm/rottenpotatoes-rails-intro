-# I was stuck on the very first part of part 1 for 2 hours (1 hour in Thursday's class - requested help from Kathryn, and over an hour in my down-time at work).
-# The problem there was that I had spaces between %th and =, which is incredibly frustrating. 
-# I spent 3 hours working on figuring out the highlighting issue. If I change %th= to %th.hilite, the column header will be highlighted, but permanently instead of only when the column has been selected. 
-# I looked up quite a number of explanations, but none have been helpful.
